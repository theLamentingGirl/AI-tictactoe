# AI-tictactoe
A beginner project to implement AI tic tac toe and study player win ratios

# Basics :
1. `GameEngine` has the base classes used 
2. `PlayerInterface` = has classes that initiate game UI using Tkinter.
3. `CompvsUser` = run this to play the game using Tkinter.
- For 2 player play just start playing.
- if you want to play with the computer which does random choosing(no ML/AI) click CompPlay(for computer to start first,i.e. comp="O";you="X") or
click userPlay(for you to start first,i.e. you="O";comp="X") 
4. `RandomTicTacToe` = run this to show biased/unbiased game ratios for 100 runs
5. `MinMaxTTT` = run this to play the game against AI computer 
- For 2 player play just start playing 
- if you want to play with the computer which chooses based on minmax algorithm click CompPlay(for computer to start first,i.e. comp="O"; you="X") or click UserPlay (for you to start first,i.e. you="O"; comp="X")
