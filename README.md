# AI-tictactoe
A beginner project to implement AI tic tac toe and study player win ratios

# Basics :
1. `GameEngine` has the base classes used 
2. `PlayerInterface` = run this to play the game UI using Tkinter.
3. `CompvsUser` = run this to play the game.
- For 2 player play just start playing.
- if you want to play with the computer which does random choosing(no ML/AI) click CompPlay(for computer to start first,i.e. comp="O";you="X")
click userPlay(for you to start first,i.e. you="O";comp="X") 
3. `RandomTicTacToe` = run this to show biased/unbiased game ratios for 100 runs
